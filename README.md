# Web-Design-Challenge
This project was done for the University of Pennsylvania Data Analytics Bootcamp using html, Bootstrap, CSS, Pandas, and Python, working in VScode and Jupyter Lab.
The goal of the project was to use html, Bootstrap, and CSS to create a web visualization dashboard to showcase a previously completed project. 
Instead of using a project done as part of Penn homework, a personal project focusing on the use of basic machine learning to predict heart disease was used.
The showcased project is viewable on GitHub here: https://github.com/twolightsabovethesea/heart-disease

First, html was used to create the skeleton of several basic pages including a summary page, individual pages for several visualizations, a comparisons page, and a data page. Then, Bootstrap and CSS were used to add aesthetics and functionality. Descriptive and informative text was included to explain the significance of each visualization and the overall project.
