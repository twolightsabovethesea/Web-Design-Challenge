# Web-Design-Challenge
This project was done for the University of Pennsylvania Data Analytics Bootcamp using html, Bootstrap, CSS, and Pandas, Python, and Jupyter Lab.
The goal of the project was to use html, Bootstrap, and CSS to create a web visualization dashboard to showcase a previously completed project. 
Instead of using a project done as part of Penn homework, a personal project focusing on the use of basic machine learning to predict heart disease was used.
The showcased project is viewable on GitHub here: https://github.com/twolightsabovethesea/heart-disease
